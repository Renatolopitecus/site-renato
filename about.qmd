Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website. I'm Renato Borras-Chavez from Chile, a country known for its rich diversity of pinnipeds (true seals and sea lions). Fascinated by this, I have dedicated myself to studying these remarkable creatures. Given Chile's proximity to Antarctica, I've also had the opportunity to conduct extensive research in that region (who wouldn't, right?).

I have a particular interest in studying elusive pinnipeds. As you'll discover in the "Projects" section, I enjoy the challenge of investigating predators that are relatively unknown. My focus lies in ecology, physiology, and evolution, with a special emphasis on foraging behavior - the art of finding, handling, and processing food. Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with universities and programs in the United States. I earned my master's degree from San Diego State University, conducted research with NOAA for my Ph.D., and am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Baylor University.

As a naturalist and field ecologist, much of my life unfolds in the field. I derive many of my research questions from direct observations in natural habitats. Additionally, I have a passion for science communication and outreach. Hence, I am constantly engaged in various projects aimed at sharing scientific research with the public, as showcased in the "Outreach" section.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more.

Warm regards,

Renato Borras-Chavez
