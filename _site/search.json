    "text": "Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website. I’m Renato Borras-Chavez from Chile, a country known for its rich diversity of pinnipeds (true seals and sea lions). Fascinated by this, I have dedicated myself to studying these remarkable creatures. Given Chile’s proximity to Antarctica, I’ve also had the opportunity to conduct extensive research in that region (who wouldn’t, right?).\nI have a particular interest in studying elusive pinnipeds. As you’ll discover in the “Projects” section, I enjoy the challenge of investigating predators that are relatively unknown. My focus lies in ecology, physiology, and evolution, with a special emphasis on foraging behavior - the art of finding, handling, and processing food. Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with universities and programs in the United States. I earned my master’s degree from San Diego State University, conducted research with NOAA for my Ph.D., and am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Baylor University.\nAs a naturalist and field ecologist, much of my life unfolds in the field. I derive many of my research questions from direct observations in natural habitats. Additionally, I have a passion for science communication and outreach. Hence, I am constantly engaged in various projects aimed at sharing scientific research with the public, as showcased in the “Outreach” section.\nI hope you enjoy exploring this website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more.\nWarm regards,\nRenato Borras-Chavez"

Leopard seals show the highest circulating cortisol concentration ever reported for pinnipeds and also, the highest across 26 closely related Arctoid taxa. Cortisol varied by sex, body mass, and diet.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Whiskers provide time-series of toxic and essential trace elements, Se:Hg molar ratios, and stable isotope values of an apex Antarctic predator, the leopard seal (2023)\n    Led by Patrick Charapata, we found that leopard seal whiskers are an incredible tool for trace element biomonitoring. Hg, Pb, Cd and Se changed over time in relation to ẟ15N and ẟ13C values. We document higher Hg burden compared to previous studies and the Se:Hg molar ratios suggest leopard seals use Se to offset Hg Burden. How cool is that!\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Use of Blood Lactate in Assessment of Manual Capture Techniques of Zoo-Housed Crocodilians (2022)\n    Yes, not just marine mammals; crocodiles too! Led by Holly Grace Molinaro we aimed to clarify the relationship between manual capture techniques, blood lactate levels, and other varying factors in order to minimize physiological stress during manual capture and restraint events of zoo-housed crocodilians. We collected 53 blood samples of ten crocodilian species and analyzed for lactate. Measurements were related to specific behavioral and extrinsic factors. Blood lactate could be use as a new welfare marker for crocodilians in zoos.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Changes in serum adipokines during natural extended fasts in female northern elephant seals (2021)\n    Endotherms rely on adipose tissue to thermoregulate, store fat, and as an endocrine organ. In N. Elephant seals and led by Caroline L. Rzucidlo, we found that adipokines (cell-signaling molecules produce by adipose tissue that play important energy/metabolic role) change within fasting periods. Circulating adipokines are associated with body composition, cortisol and IL-6. they are also related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in seals.\n    I love Elies :) \n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n Get your popcorns…Coming up soon! (accepted and in review)\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First paired observations of sexual behavior and calls in wild leopard seals (ACCEPTED!)\n    Led by Sarah Kienle, we opportunistically observed and report the first sexual interaction of leopard seals in the wild and outside Antarctica! An example of the importance of observing nature when doing sciences.\n    Coming soon\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Occurrence, residency, and habitat characterization of leopard seals in Chile (in Review)\n    Led by Renato Borras-Chavez, we present evidence that leopard seals have been living in Chile for centuries following multiyear resident leps, with numbers of leps increasing and several birth records for the region.

I am an ecophysiologist working in what I call “Integrative Predator Ecology”, in my case, the interface between foraging ecology, population ecology and Physiology. In the last 10 years, my research models have mostly been pinnipeds. Since I am Chilean, most of my work has been done in Chilean species as well as Antarctic species. Before these ten years I was lucky enough to also work in subtidal ecology, specifically in ecology of Kelp forest. This gave me a broader perspective of how ecosystems work and are regulated and the “integrative” word of my research is also the result of accepting a big integration of multidisciplines, approaches and collaborators for the understanding and conservation of the ecoystems I work in."
