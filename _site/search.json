    "text": "Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website. I’m Renato Borras-Chavez from Chile, a country known for its rich diversity of pinnipeds (true seals and sea lions). Fascinated by this, I have dedicated myself to studying these remarkable creatures. Given Chile’s proximity to Antarctica, I’ve also had the opportunity to conduct extensive research in that region (who wouldn’t, right?).\nI have a particular interest in studying elusive pinnipeds. As you’ll discover in the “Projects” section, I enjoy the challenge of investigating predators that are relatively unknown. My focus lies in ecology, physiology, and evolution, with a special emphasis on foraging behavior - the art of finding, handling, and processing food. Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with universities and programs in the United States. I earned my master’s degree from San Diego State University, conducted research with NOAA for my Ph.D., and am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Baylor University.\nAs a naturalist and field ecologist, much of my life unfolds in the field. I derive many of my research questions from direct observations in natural habitats. Additionally, I have a passion for science communication and outreach. Hence, I am constantly engaged in various projects aimed at sharing scientific research with the public, as showcased in the “Outreach” section.\nI hope you enjoy exploring this website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more.\nWarm regards,\nRenato Borras-Chavez"

Using citizen sciences, strandings, and research expeditions, we identified multiyear resident aggregations in two areas of Patagonia and provide an account of births in Chile. Then Dr. Rodrigo Soteres did his magic and with his glacier expertise we characterized their glacial habitat preferences and assessed potential glaciars that may hold leopardseals across Chile. Findings highlight their reliance on ice and vulnerability to climate change-driven glacial retreat.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First paired observations of sexual behavior and calls in wild leopard seals (2024)\n    This was our first baby from our work in the San Rafael National Park. Led by Dr. Kienle we meticulously documented a two-hour courtship interaction between a male and a female in Chile, providing the first detailed account of their sexual behaviors and associated vocalizations in their natural habitat. All this highlight Laguna San Rafael in South America as an important breeding area for this Southern Ocean predator.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Whiskers provide time-series of toxic and essential trace elements, Se:Hg molar ratios, and stable isotope values of an apex Antarctic predator, the leopard seal (2023)\n    Led by Dr Charapata, we found that leopard seal whiskers are an incredible tool for trace element biomonitoring. Hg, Pb, Cd and Se changed over time in relation to ẟ15N and ẟ13C values. We document higher Hg burden compared to previous studies and the Se:Hg molar ratios suggest leopard seals use Se to offset Hg Burden.

Larger individuals (females) with high-trophic diets have lower cortisol, while smaller individuals show the opposite. Leopard seals exhibit exceptionally high cortisol, possibly an adaptation. Findings provide crucial baseline data for assessing their response to changes.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Plasticity in the morphometrics and movements of an Antarctic apex predator, the leopard seal (2022)\n    Dr. Sarah Kienle analyzed the satellite tracking data of our 22 leopard seals tagged near the Western Antarctic Peninsula to investigate their movement patterns including diving behavior. We also found female-biased sexual size dimorphism in leopard seals, with females being considerably larger than males, and also highlights substantial individual variability in how far the seals travel and their diving strategies. Ultimately, the findings suggest that this flexibility may be crucial for leopard seals to adapt to the rapidly changing environment of the Southern Ocean.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n Get your popcorns…Coming up soon! (leopard seal MSs accepted and in review)\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Individual Specialization in a Generalist Apex Predator: The Leopard Seal (ACCEPTED!)\n    Dr. Sperou led this work that aimed to explore feeding habits of leopard seals, challenging the assumption that individuals are always dietary generalists. Emily analyzed stable isotopes signatures in whiskers to reveal significant individual specialization in their diets, with most seals consistently focusing on specific prey while only a few acting as true generalists. This specialization, even by a small number of seals, have a substantial impact on local prey populations, highlighting the broader ecological importance of understanding individual-level foraging behaviors in apex predators.\n    Coming soon\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First Record of Prolonged Postmortem Attentive Behavior in Pinnipeds: Behavioral Observations from Leopard Seals (in Review)\n    Led by a co-first authorship of Drs Sperou and Borras-Chavez, we documented Postmortem attentive behavior (PAB), a rare form of epimeletic behavior, in leopard seals for the first time and the longest ever recorded in pinnipeds. We present pictures and videos of four different ocassions of PAB in multiple sites of Patagonia. The animals were carrying and mounthing the carcass of their pups. We also performed a full necropsy on one of the pups. You guys cannot imagine how cool was to observe this behavior in real time\n    Coming soon"

I long admired the work done by Daniel Torres with pinnipeds at Cape Shirreff, Antarctica for more than 20 years, being the first guy ever putting a station there. He collected a lot of data that was lost in piles of printed documents at the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH). I recovered it and reorganized it and then told Dr. Goebel and Dr. Krause that we should put together this data with the next 20 years of data they collected at this location and Sam Woodman was the bartender of this cocktail. The Cape Shirreff Phocid Census (CS-PHOC) dataset is a valuable collection of weekly counts of four seal species at Cape Shirreff, Antarctica, spanning most austral summers since 1997. It is the result of a long-term collaboration between INACH and the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program to monitor phocid populations in a region undergoing rapid climate change. This publicly available dataset on the SCAR Biodiversity Portal provides crucial information for understanding population trends and habitat use of these key Southern Ocean predators.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Southern Ocean food-webs and climate\nchange: A short review and future directions (2024)\n    Dr Jose Queiros is awesome we have worked together in the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) for a long time, and he invited me to write with him this review. We synthesize current understanding of Southern Ocean food webs and their vulnerability to climate change. We examine the structure of these Antarctic ecosystems, highlighting the traditional view of a krill-dominated system while also emphasizing the importance of alternative food pathways. We also discussed various methodologies used to study these complex networks, their strengths, and limitations, and concludes by outlining future research directions and the significant role of early career researchers in advancing this critical field of polar study.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Novel penguin Avian avulaviruses 17, 18 and 19 are widely distributed in the Antarctic Peninsula (2019)\n    Lead by Florencia Olivares, we investigated the prevalence and distribution of three newly identified penguin avian avulaviruses (PAVs 17, 18, and 19) across the Antarctic Peninsula. Samples came from– Gentoo, Adélie, and Chinstrap – at seven different locations and used antibody tests to determine if the penguins had been exposed to these viruses. The findings revealed that these novel PAVs are widespread among the studied penguin populations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting the viruses can infect all three species over a large geographical range. This research provides the first broad serological evidence of these viruses in Antarctic penguins.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\nA Past life of Kelp Forest Ecology\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Testing sustainable management in Northern Chile: harvesting Macrocystis pyrifera (Phaeophyceae, Laminariales). A case study (2012)\n    My goal was to identify a sustainable harvesting protocol for Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) that could support the local kelp harvesting industry while preserving the kelp resources. I tested harvesting methods in northern Chile, including the typical which was removing the complete algal unit. then I evaluate the impacts on kelp regrowth, recruitment, herbivores, and algal diversity. We end up recommending harvesting half the fronds (half the stipes growing on a bolder) as the most sustainable approach for ecological and industry balance.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n   \n    Repetitive harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera (Phaeophyceae) and its effects on chemical constituents of economic value (2016)\n    I examinate whether repeated harvesting of giant kelp over a three-month period altered the alginate yield, quality, and the nutritional content relevant for aquaculture. Their findings suggest that while these properties fluctuate over time, likely due to environmental factors, repetitive harvesting itself does not significantly degrade these economically important constituents. This research contributes to understanding sustainable kelp harvesting practices, especially in regions where kelp abundance is low.\n    Full Publication\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Morphological, ultrastructural, and genetic characterization of coalescence in the intertidal and shallow subtidal kelps Lessonia spicata and L. berteroana (Laminariales, Heterokontophyta) (2014)\n    This was a beautiful work that I did for three years while working with the brilliant National Sciences Award, Dr. Bernabe Santelices (and his gang). Led by Dr. Alejandra Gonzalez, we investigate the phenomenon of coalescence in kelps (where individual kelp individuals fuse together) in two dominant Chilean kelp species. I did the lab work to characterize the cellular changes during fusion of natural populations to determine the prevalence of these fused, genetically diverse individuals, known as chimeras. We found that coalescence is a frequent process in these kelps, involving specific modifications at the cellular level, and that chimerism is widespread in natural settings, suggesting potential ecological advantages for these fused organisms in their intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats.\n    Full Publication"

In the last 10 years, my research models have mostly been pinnipeds. Since I am Chilean, most of my work has been done in Chilean species as well as Antarctic species. Before these ten years I was lucky enough to also work in subtidal ecology, specifically in ecology of Kelp forest.
