    "text": "Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website. I’m Renato Borras-Chavez from Chile, a country known for its rich diversity of pinnipeds (true seals and sea lions). Fascinated by this, I have dedicated myself to studying these remarkable creatures. Given Chile’s proximity to Antarctica, I’ve also had the opportunity to conduct extensive research in that region (who wouldn’t, right?).\nI have a particular interest in studying elusive pinnipeds. As you’ll discover in the “Projects” section, I enjoy the challenge of investigating predators that are relatively unknown. My focus lies in ecology, physiology, and evolution, with a special emphasis on foraging behavior - the art of finding, handling, and processing food. Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with universities and programs in the United States. I earned my master’s degree from San Diego State University, conducted research with NOAA for my Ph.D., and am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Baylor University.\nAs a naturalist and field ecologist, much of my life unfolds in the field. I derive many of my research questions from direct observations in natural habitats. Additionally, I have a passion for science communication and outreach. Hence, I am constantly engaged in various projects aimed at sharing scientific research with the public, as showcased in the “Outreach” section.\nI hope you enjoy exploring this website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more.\nWarm regards,\nRenato Borras-Chavez\n\n\nNo se porque se mantuvo esto (estaba probando una cosa que no funciono pero se hizo comit con esta parte del codigo igual y debiese borrarse (lo que queria era agregar la foto mia al costado del texto que agregue pero se me fue en collera."
