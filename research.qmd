As an integrative ecologist, I work in transdisciplinary sciences, the space between foraging ecology, behavioral ecology, population ecology, and socioecology. My research explores predator-environment interactions by combining methods such as: diet estimators, geospatial analysis, computer vision, machine learning, and social sciences. By integrating multiple lines of research, different methods and working together with a variety of institutions, I aim to use advanced ecological knowledge to help building science-based conservation and monitoring programs.

    <h5 class="card-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Occurrence, residency, and habitat characterization of leopard seals in Chile (2024)</h5>
    <p class="card-text">I challenged the view of leopard seals as strictly Antarctic, quantifying their long-term presence in Chilean Patagonia. Using citizen sciences, strandings, and research expeditions, we identified multiyear resident aggregations in two areas of Patagonia and provide an account of births in Chile. Then Dr. Rodrigo Soteres did his magic and with his glacier expertise we characterized their glacial habitat preferences and assessed potential glaciars that may hold leopardseals across Chile. Findings highlight their reliance on ice and vulnerability to climate change-driven glacial retreat.</p>

Led by Dr. Kienle we meticulously documented a two-hour courtship interaction between a male and a female in Chile, providing the first detailed account of their sexual behaviors and associated vocalizations in their natural habitat. All this highlight Laguna San Rafael in South America as an important breeding area for this Southern Ocean predator.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Dr. Sperou lead a great work where she examined cortisol levels in leopard seals, linking them to sex, body mass, and diet. Larger individuals (females) with high-trophic diets have lower cortisol, while smaller individuals show the opposite. Leopard seals exhibit exceptionally high cortisol, possibly an adaptation. Findings provide crucial baseline data for assessing their response to changes.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Dr. Sarah Kienle analyzed the satellite tracking data of our 22 leopard seals tagged near the Western Antarctic Peninsula to investigate their movement patterns including diving behavior. We also found female-biased sexual size dimorphism in leopard seals, with females being considerably larger than males, and also highlights substantial individual variability in how far the seals travel and their diving strategies. Ultimately, the findings suggest that this flexibility may be crucial for leopard seals to adapt to the rapidly changing environment of the Southern Ocean.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Dr. Sperou led this work that aimed to explore feeding habits of leopard seals, challenging the assumption that individuals are always dietary generalists. Emily analyzed stable isotopes signatures in whiskers to reveal significant individual specialization in their diets, with most seals consistently focusing on specific prey while only a few acting as true generalists. This specialization, even by a small number of seals, have a substantial impact on local prey populations, highlighting the broader ecological importance of understanding individual-level foraging behaviors in apex predators.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Led by a co-first authorship of Drs Sperou and Borras-Chavez, we documented Postmortem attentive behavior (PAB), a rare form of epimeletic behavior, in leopard seals for the first time and the longest ever recorded in pinnipeds. We present pictures and videos of four different ocassions of PAB in multiple sites of Patagonia. The animals were carrying and mounthing the carcass of their pups. We also performed a full necropsy on one of the pups. You guys cannot imagine how cool was to observe this behavior in real time</p>

    <p class="card-text">Yes, not just marine mammals; crocodiles too! Led by Holly Grace Molinaro we aimed to clarify the relationship between manual capture techniques, blood lactate levels, and other varying factors in order to minimize physiological stress during manual capture and restraint events of zoo-housed crocodilians. We collected 53 blood samples of ten crocodilian species and analyzed for lactate. Measurements were related to specific behavioral and extrinsic factors. Blood lactate could be use as a new welfare marker for crocodilians in zoos.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Endotherms rely on adipose tissue to thermoregulate, store fat, and as an endocrine organ. In N. Elephant seals and led by Caroline L. Rzucidlo, we found that adipokines (cell-signaling molecules produce by adipose tissue that play important energy/metabolic role) change within fasting periods. Circulating adipokines are associated with body composition, cortisol and IL-6. they are also related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in seals.
