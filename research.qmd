As an integrative ecologist, I work in transdisciplinary sciences, the space between foraging ecology, behavioral ecology, population ecology, and socioecology. My research explores predator-environment interactions by combining methods such as: diet estimators, geospatial analysis, computer vision, machine learning, and social sciences. By integrating multiple lines of research, different methods and working together with a variety of institutions, I aim to use advanced ecological knowledge to help building science-based conservation and monitoring programs.

    <h5 class="card-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Occurrence, residency, and habitat characterization of leopard seals in Chile (2024)</h5>
    <p class="card-text">I challenged the view of leopard seals as strictly Antarctic, quantifying their long-term presence in Chilean Patagonia. Using citizen sciences, strandings, and research expeditions, we identified multiyear resident aggregations in two areas of Patagonia and provide an account of births in Chile. Then Dr. Rodrigo Soteres did his magic and with his glacier expertise we characterized their glacial habitat preferences and assessed potential glaciars that may hold leopardseals across Chile. Findings highlight their reliance on ice and vulnerability to climate change-driven glacial retreat.</p>

Hg, Pb, Cd and Se changed over time in relation to ẟ15N and ẟ13C values.

Larger individuals (females) with high-trophic diets have lower cortisol, while smaller individuals show the opposite. Leopard seals exhibit exceptionally high cortisol, possibly an adaptation. Findings provide crucial baseline data for assessing their response to changes.</p>

We also found female-biased sexual size dimorphism in leopard seals, with females being considerably larger than males, and also highlights substantial individual variability in how far the seals travel and their diving strategies. Ultimately, the findings suggest that this flexibility may be crucial for leopard seals to adapt to the rapidly changing environment of the Southern Ocean.</p>

Emily analyzed stable isotopes signatures in whiskers to reveal significant individual specialization in their diets, with most seals consistently focusing on specific prey while only a few acting as true generalists. This specialization, even by a small number of seals, have a substantial impact on local prey populations, highlighting the broader ecological importance of understanding individual-level foraging behaviors in apex predators.</p>

We present pictures and videos of four different ocassions of PAB in multiple sites of Patagonia. The animals were carrying and mounthing the carcass of their pups.

    <p class="card-text">I have to give a bit more context to this data paper. I long admired the work done by Daniel Torres with pinnipeds at Cape Shirreff, Antarctica for more than 20 years, being the first guy ever putting a station there. He collected a lot of data that was lost in piles of printed documents at the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH). I recovered it and reorganized it and then told Dr. Goebel and Dr. Krause that we should put together this data with the next 20 years of data they collected at this location and Sam Woodman was the bartender of this cocktail. The Cape Shirreff Phocid Census (CS-PHOC) dataset is a valuable collection of weekly counts of four seal species at Cape Shirreff, Antarctica, spanning most austral summers since 1997. It is the result of a long-term collaboration between INACH and the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program to monitor phocid populations in a region undergoing rapid climate change. This publicly available dataset on the SCAR Biodiversity Portal provides crucial information for understanding population trends and habitat use of these key Southern Ocean predators.</p>

Samples came from– Gentoo, Adélie, and Chinstrap – at seven different locations and used antibody tests to determine if the penguins had been exposed to these viruses. The findings revealed that these novel PAVs are widespread among the studied penguin populations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting the viruses can infect all three species over a large geographical range. This research provides the first broad serological evidence of these viruses in Antarctic penguins.</p>

I tested harvesting methods in northern Chile, including the typical which was removing the complete algal unit. then I evaluate the impacts on kelp regrowth, recruitment, herbivores, and algal diversity. We end up recommending harvesting half the fronds (half the stipes growing on a bolder) as the most sustainable approach for ecological and industry balance.</p>

Led by Dr. Alejandra Gonzalez, we investigate the phenomenon of coalescence in kelps (where individual kelp individuals fuse together) in two dominant Chilean kelp species. I did the lab work to characterize the cellular changes during fusion of natural populations to determine the prevalence of these fused, genetically diverse individuals, known as chimeras. We found that coalescence is a frequent process in these kelps, involving specific modifications at the cellular level, and that chimerism is widespread in natural settings, suggesting potential ecological advantages for these fused organisms in their intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats.</p>
